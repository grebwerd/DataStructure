DataStructure
=============

Practice making Data Structures in C++

mkdir ~/DataStructure
# Creates a directory for your project called "DataStructure" in your user directory

cd ~/DataStructure
# Changes the current working directory to your newly created directory

git init
# Sets up the necessary Git files
# Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/you/Hello-World/.git/

touch README
# Creates a file called "README" in your Hello-World directory
